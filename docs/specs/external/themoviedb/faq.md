### What is TMDB's API?

The API service is for those of you interested in using our movie, TV show or actor images and/or data in your application. Our API is a system we provide for you and your team to programmatically fetch and use our data and/or images.

### How do I apply for an API key?

You can apply for an API key by clicking the "API" link from the left hand sidebar within your account settings page.

### Is there an SLA?

We do not currently provide an SLA. However, we do make every reasonable attempt to keep our service online and accessible. You can view our status page [here](https://status.themoviedb.org).

### Are there any API wrappers or libraries I can use?

There sure is! Check them out [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/wrappers-and-libraries).

### What about SSL?

It's currently available API wide. This includes both the API endpoints and assets served via our CDN. We strongly recommend you use SSL.

### Is there a commercial service?

Yes. You can contact our sales team by emailing sales@themoviedb.org. Please include the country you're from to help us expedite your request. You can also visit our API sales page for more information.

### What is the difference between a commercial API and a developer API?

A commercial API is for commercial projects and a developer API is for developers. Your project is considered commercial if the primary purpose is to create revenue for the benefit of the owner.

### Does the API key cost anything?

Our API is free to use for non-commercial purposes as long as you attribute TMDB as the source of the data and/or images. If you are interested in obtaining a license to use our API and/or our data/images for commercial purposes, please contact sales@themoviedb.org. Please include the country you're from to help us expedite your request.

### Does the API ever change? How can I learn about new features?

Yes, it can from time to time. We try our best to post these relevant updates to the official documentation. You can also keep tabs on our Trello board.

### What are the attribution requirements?

You shall use the TMDB logo to identify your use of the TMDB APIs.

You shall place the following notice prominently on your application: "This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB."

Any use of the TMDB logo in your application shall be less prominent than the logo or mark that primarily describes the application and your use of the TMDB logo shall not imply any endorsement by TMDB.

When attributing TMDB, the attribution must be within your application's "About" or "Credits" type section.

When using a TMDB logo, we require you to use one of our approved logos.

### Can I make changes to the API?

No, you cannot. Our API is closed source.

### Are there branding requirements?

Our logo should not be modified in color, aspect ratio, flipped or rotated except where otherwise noted. Our logo can be white, black or any of the approved colors used throughout our branding. For a list of official logos, see our logos & attribution page.

When referring to TMDB, you should use either the acronym "TMDB" or the full name "The Movie Database". Any other name is not acceptable.
